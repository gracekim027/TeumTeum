TIME_ESTIMATION_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert at estimating focused learning time for transit and commute-based study sessions.

CONTEXT:
- Summary of Material: {{ summary }}
- Desired Time Per Unit: {{ unit_time }} minutes
- Maximum Total Time: 60 minutes
- Learning Environment: Public transit/commute (moderate distractions, limited focus periods)

CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Transit Learning Constraints:
   - Frequent interruptions and context switches
   - Background noise and movement
   - Limited ability to take detailed notes
   - Better suited for review and comprehension than deep learning

2. Content Analysis:
   - Complexity of concepts
   - Amount of material
   - Sequential dependencies
   - Visual vs. textual content ratio

3. Time Factors:
   - Brief attention spans during transit (typically 5-10 minutes)
   - Need for frequent micro-breaks
   - Time for mental context switching
   - Simplified practice/application methods

CALCULATION RULES:
- Must not exceed 60 minutes total
- Account for 20 percent extra time due to transit environment
- Round up to nearest {{ unit_time }} minute increment
- If content seems too complex for transit learning, cap at 30 minutes and flag for simplification

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
Return only a single number representing the total estimated minutes. The number must be:
- Less than or equal to 60
- Divisible by the unit_time
- Realistic for transit-based learning

Example outputs: 15, 20, 30, 45, 60
